                        <p>
                        We are the <b>Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers</b> here at the University of Oklahoma. As one of the <b>largest Asian-interest and STEM-focused organizations</b> on campus, we celebrate Asian culture with our members who 
                        come from diverse STEM and cultural backgrounds.  Our goals are to <u>cultivate professionalism</u>, <u>develop cultural awareness</u>, and <u>serve our local community</u>. Our mission is to provide our membership with the knowledge, 
                        experience, and connections necessary to entering the professional world. <br /><br /> Diversity-focused organizations such as ours serve a niche but crucial role on campus.  Oklahoma, particularly Oklahoma City, served as a 
                        major destination for refugees during the Vietnam War.  These refugees, sponsored by Oklahomaâ€™s Christian institutions, were able to establish themselves in the community thanks to the help of many generous Oklahomans.  
                        This means that the majority of our members are 1st and 2nd-generation students, along with a growing number of international students.  OU SASE builds that supportive community and safe space for individuals with these shared experiences.
